what are the properties present inside the font or text?
font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
font-size:30px;
font-weight: 900;
font-style: normal;
How many font-family will support inside our browser?
//It will support more then one font-family
//But using minimum three font-family is the best approach. 
Because if sometimes font-family is not supported in browser will choose the next alternative path.
===============================
Mobile responsive or Media query or Breakpoints
1.we have breakpoints to target the device screen.
2.we need to write media query for following devices:
   (i)phone and mobile - max-width:480px
   (v)extra large screen - (min-width:1200px)
example:
@media (max-width:480px){

}  
3.Browser will take care automatically.
4.just we need to write breakpoints
5.we need to add viewports to make it work.
=================================
CSS Units:
1.px -font-size-border-padding-height
2.% - width-margin-height
3.rem - it will inherit from parent element.
2px - 1rem=2px
4.vw - 1vw = 1% of viewport width
5.vh - 1vh = 1% of viewport height.
6.em  - 1em = 16px
======================================
Any project layout 
//You can always proceed with px 
//always use flex or grid 
====================================
box-sizing:
//Padding wil be adjusted whatever the width and height we have given for that particular element.
=======================================
