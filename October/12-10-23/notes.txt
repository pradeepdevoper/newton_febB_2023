Loops:
1.for loop - normal iteration or array
//if condition met then only it will run the loop
2.while loop - normal iteration or array
//if condition met then only it will run the loop
3.do-while loop - normal iteration or array
//you can run this loop even condition failed for first time.
4.for in loop - mainly used to iterate object otherwise you can use for array also
example:
let person ={
    name:"akash"
}
for(let input in person){

}
//input is user defined variable 
//person is user defined object 
5.infinite loop - there is no end
//please avoid infinite loop because your code will break.
//always there should be condition to break it.
6.for of loop - it used mainly with array 
let arrList=[33,44,55,66];
for(let input of arrList){
    console.log(input);
}
===================================
Functions types 
1.normal function or function declaration 
2.function declaration
//This function is a standalone application
//function name should be present
//This function you can call before and after function declaration.
example:
function addition(a,b){

}
3.function expression 
//function expression a function without name 
//function is declare inside the variable 
//you can call the function only after declaration.
//while declaring you can use let or const
//const is best way to declare a function 
example: 
const display= function(fullName,age){
     console.log(fullName,age);
}
4.first class function 
//first class function if function in that language are treated like other variable
//passing as argument 
//can be returned by another function 


5.arrow function
6.callback function
