2.comparison operator and Equality operator
     (i)   =   (assignment operator)
     (ii)  ==  (double equality operator)
          //It will check both value is same or not
          //final result will be in boolean
          //It will work with string,number,boolean
          //right result it will return true 
          //wrong result it will return false 
     (iii) === (triple equality operator)
     (iv) < (lesser then)
     (v)  > (greater then)
     (vi) <= (lesster then and equal to)
     (vii) >= (greater then and equal to)
     (viii) != (not equality operator)
