2.comparison operator and Equality operator
     (i)   =   (assignment operator)
     (ii)  ==  (double equality operator)
          //It will check both value is same or not
          //final result will be in boolean
          //It will work with string,number,boolean
          //right result it will return true 
          //wrong result it will return false 
          //It will check only value not datatype
     (iii) === (triple equality operator)
          //It will check value and datatype is same or not
          //final result will be in boolean
          //It will work with string,number,boolean
          //right result it will return true 
          //wrong result it will return false 
     (iv) < (lesser then)
     //It will return boolean value 
     //Mostly it is use with number.
     (v)  > (greater then)
      //It will return boolean value 
      //Mostly it is use with number.
     (vi) <= (lesster then and equal to)
       //It will return boolean value 
      //Mostly it is use with number.
      //It will make boolean true if both value are same
     (vii) >= (greater then and equal to)
       //It will return boolean value 
       //Mostly it is use with number.
       //It will make boolean true if both value are same
     (viii) != (not equality operator)
      //it will return boolean value 
      //It is exactly opposite of == operator.
3.logical operator 
   //all logical operator will return boolean value
     (i)&& --> and operator
       //If any one false means false
       //You can have multiple operands but minium should be two
       //always give priority for negative condition on left hand side
       T && T = T 
       T && F = F 
       F && T = F 
       F && F = F 
     (ii)|| --> or operator 
       //If any one true means true
       //You can have multiple operands but minium should be two
       //always give priority for positive condition on left hand side.
       T || T = T 
       T || F = T 
       F || T = T 
       F || F = F 
     (iii)! --> not operator 
        //we need single operands
        //T -- F 


4.Ternary operator
    condition?true_statement:false_statement;
=============================================
Decision Making 
if/else 
//if condition is true it will execute if statement otherwise else statment 
//only if condition also you can write it 
//only else condition is not possible.
=============================================
function:
//Set of repetative task we can write inside the function 
//function is nothing but a set of code written in one block 
//function name should start will small case.
example:
function function_name(){

}
function_name();

function with parameters
//we are passing input values to the function 
//you can pass any number of parameters 
//you can pass any datatype
function function_name(speed,name){

}

function_name(4,'lg');

function with return statement:
//function is returning an value.
